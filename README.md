## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non=ranfdom amount of variance to the mpg values?
ground clearance, vehcile weight, and vehicle length

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
with multiple linear regression, it is nearly impossible to effeciently plot the data, and due to this complexity it would not be possibly to make assumptions about the slope of the model.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
It does, the high r-squared value indicates that it is fairly reliable at predicting the protoypes mpg.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
